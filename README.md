A simple example which retrieves metadata and a sample frame through multiple
methods:  `pycamhd.lazycache` to both a local instance and the global
Google-hosted instance of lazycache, `pycamhd.lazyqt` and `pycamhd`.

For the local and global instance of Lazycache, and `pycamhd.lazyqt`, the movie
data is pulled from Rutgers.

For `pycamhd` as well as one of the test with the local version of Lazycache,
the movie data is retrieved from the local disk.
